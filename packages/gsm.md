# The GSM package [ver. 0.17] <a name="gsm-package"></a> ###############################################

The **GSM** (a.k.a. *Generate Secure Macros*) package allows
to create secured macros stored in SAS Proc FCMP functions.
The dataset with functions can be shared and allows to generate 
macros without showing their code.

The GSM package is basically an automated version of the following:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sas
proc fcmp outlib = work.gsm.secure ENCRYPT;
  function generateMacro() $;
    rc = RESOLVE('
      %macro secretMacro(x) / SECURE;
        data test;
         a = "&x.";
        run;
      %mend;
    ');
    return (rc);
  endsub;
run;

/* share work.gsm dataset */
options cmplib = work.gsm;
data _null_;
  rc = generateMacro();
  put rc=;
run;

/* enjoy */
%secretMacro(42)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See examples for more details.

Recording of presentation with "how it works" description, in Polish, is avaliable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtaWPe2sgRY&t=1s).

*How to use it:* 
 - Copy all files with your secured macros code into a directory. 
   Best approach is to have one file for one macro.
 - Copy a path to the directory.
 - Run the following code:
   ```
   %GSM(<the path to directory>, cmplib=<name of the dataset>)
   ```
 - Share generated `ZIP` file (unzip and run the code).
 
*Limitations:* 
 Single macro file cannot be longer than 32760 bytes.

## >>> `%GSM()` macro: <<< <a name="gsm-macro"></a> #######################

The `%GSM()` macro is the main macro of 
the **GSM** (a.k.a. *Generate Secure Macros*) package. 

It converts a list of macros provided by the user into
a data set of the Proc FCMP functions. The macros are stored
in functions are encrypted which allow to share them without 
showing their code. *Important* thing is that macros provided 
by the user *has* to be "secure", i.e. the `secure` option has to 
be added to the macro definition. See the example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sas
%macro secretMacro(x) / SECURE; /* <- the secure option */
  <... some code ...>
%mend secretMacro;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


As a result a zip file, containing dataset with functions and 
code to be executed on site, is generated. 

Since encrypted code is stored in a SAS dataset it has
no limitation in sharing between operating systems (like catalogs have).

*Limitation:* Due to the `Resolve()` function limitations 
 a single macro file cannot be longer than 32760 bytes.

*Notes:* 
- All macros have to have the `secure` option added, i.e. `%macro aMacroname(...) / SECURE ;`.
- During the execution a test macro, named `%GSMpck_dummyMacroForTests()`, is generated.
- The `%GSM()` macro calls the `%GSMpck_makeFCMPcode(...)` macro internally.

### SYNTAX: ###################################################################

The basic syntax is the following, the `<...>` means optional parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sas
%GSM( 
   path
 <,trim=0>
 <,cmplib=work.generateMacros>
 <,source2=>
 <,outpath=>
 <,encodingRestricted=>
 <,secret=>
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Arguments description**:

1. `path`               - *Required*, indicates a directory which contains files with macros.
                          Only files with `sas` extension are used.

* `trim=`               - *Optional*, the default value is `0`.
                          If set to `1` then lines of macro code are trimmed.
                          If set to `2` then lines of macro code are stripped.

* `cmplib=`             - *Optional*, the default value is `work.generateMacros`. 
                          Names the dataset which will contain generated functions. 

* `source2=`            - *Optional*, the default value is null. 
                          Indicate if `%includ`-ed files are printed out.
                          Any value other than null enables printing.

* `outpath=`            - *Optional*, the default value is set the same as the `path`.
                          Points a directory in which a result (a zip file) is generated.

* `encodingRestricted=` - *Optional*, the default value is `0`.
                          If set to 1 then if User session encoding is different from 
                          encoding of the session which generates the dataset then 
                          the generateMacros() function will not execute macro code.

* `secret=`             - *Optional*, the default value is null, in such case the 
                          secret is generated from the `sha256(datetime(), hex32.)` function 
                          and is printed in the log. When not null then should be
                          alphanumerical constant. Non-alphanumerical characters are removed.
                          Required to execute the `resolve()` function. 
                          User who do not know the value will not be able
                          to run the `_maxro_XX_()` function.

### Example: ###################################################################

Example 1. Prepare 2 files: `f1.sas` and `f2.sas` and use the `%GSM()` macro.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sas
%let path = %sysfunc(pathname(work))/path2files;

%put &=path.;
options dlcreatedir;
libname path "&path.";
filename path "&path.";

data _null_;
  file path(f1.sas);
  input;
  put _infile_;
cards4;
%macro abc(x) / SECURE;
  data test;
    do i = 1 to &x.;
      put i=;
    end;
  run;
%mend;
;;;;
run;

data _null_;
  file path(f2.sas);
  input;
  put _infile_;
cards4;
%macro xyz(x) / SECURE;
  %do i = 1 %to &x.;
    %put &=i;
  %end;
%mend;
;;;;
run;

%GSM(&path., cmplib=work.myMacros)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 
## >>> `%GSMpck_makeFCMPcode()` macro: <<< <a name="gsmpck-makefcmpcode-macro"></a> #######################

The `%GSMpck_makeFCMPcode()` macro is an internal macro of 
the **GSM** (a.k.a. *Generate Secure Macros*) package. 

It executes a process of converting 
a macro provided by the user into
a Proc FCMP function. 

Since encrypted code is stored in a SAS dataset it has
no limitation in sharing between operating systems (like catalogs have).

*Limitation:* Single macro file cannot be longer than 32760 bytes.

### SYNTAX: ###################################################################

The basic syntax is the following, the `<...>` means optional parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sas
%GSMpck_makeFCMPcode( 
   path
  ,number
 <,trim=0>
 <,outlib=work.generateMacros.secure>
 <,source2=>
 <,fileNameCode=FNC>
 <,secret=123456789>
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Arguments description**:

1. `path`         - *Required*, indicates a directory which contains files with macros.
                    Only files with `sas` extension are used.
